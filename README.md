# Abstract

A fundamental question for society is how much happiness does a dollar
buy? The accepted view among economists and psychologists is that money
and happiness increase together up to a point, after which there is
little further gain from increasing income. The location of this change
point was reportedly USD$75K in 2008, which was substantially more than
the median income in the same year (USD$52K), indicating the happiness
or wellbeing of the poorest majority of the population was tied to
marginal changes in income while the wellbeing of a richer minority was
not. Thus the location of the change point has implications for the
distribution of wellbeing between the rich and poor. Inequalities in
wellbeing are increasingly relevant due to the growing recognition that
increasing income does not neccesarily lead to equal changes in
wellbeing. In this paper we estimate the relationship between income and
subjective wellbeing over a 19-year period focusing on whether this
change point has shifted over time, and explore its implications for
inequalities in wellbeing. To date there has been no investigation as to
whether the change point has increased or decreased over time so we
formally tested for the presence of a change point as well temporal
changes in the relationship between income and affective wellbeing
(happiness), and income and cognitive wellbeing (life satisfaction),
using household economic data from Australia between 2001-2019. The
results revealed the change point between affective wellbeing and income
has increased over those 19 years faster than inflation (i.e., cost of
living). This suggests that inequalities in income may be driving
increasing *inequities* in happiness between the rich and the poor, with
implications for health and recent government policy-goals to monitor
and improve wellbeing.
